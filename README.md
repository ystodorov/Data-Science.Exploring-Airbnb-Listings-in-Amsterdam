# Data-Science.Exploring-Airbnb-Listings-in-Amsterdam

In this project we'll analyze data about AirBNB listings in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The data is taken from http://insideairbnb.com/ and is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site. It has been scraped from the website on 05 June, 2023. The project was created as part of an assignment during my education in the AI program of SoftUni.
